# Rezumap

Start of a website, which aimed to reference in France all the CVs of people looking for a job and to display
them on a map of France in order to facilitate the search for employees for companies.

The site was entirely coded by me, in html css js, and with the connection to an api for the map.

The project has been put on stand by due to lack of time, if ever a developer is interested do not hesitate to contact me.
